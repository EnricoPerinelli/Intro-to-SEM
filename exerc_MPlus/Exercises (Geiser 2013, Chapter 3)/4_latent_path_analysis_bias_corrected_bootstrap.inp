title: Latent path model shown in Figure 3.15
       Relationship between physical health, functional health, and subjective health
       
       
data: file = health.dat;

variable: names = SHP ! Subjektive health in the present
                  SHC ! Changes in subjective health across the past 6 years
                  SICK ! Number of health issues in the past 12 months
                  CONSULT ! Number of physician consultations in the past 12 months
                  FH ! Total score SF-36 scale on functional health 
                  FH1 FH2; ! SF-36 scale split into 2 test halves/item parcels 
          
          usevar = SHP SHC SICK CONSULT FH1 FH2;

analysis: type = general;


model: SH by SHP SHC; ! Factor/Measurement model subjective health
       PH by SICK CONSULT; ! Factor/Measurement model physical health
       FH by FH1 FH2; ! Factor/Measurement model functional health

! Path analysis at the level of the latent variables
       FH on PH; 
       SH on PH FH; 
 
       model indirect: SH ind PH; ! Request output of direct, indirect, and total effects
